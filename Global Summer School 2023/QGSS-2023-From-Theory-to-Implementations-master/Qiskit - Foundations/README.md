# Qiskit - Foundation

Learning  and Discovery of Quantum Computers and Programming Quantum Algorithms on Quantum Computers.

Qiskit for How to program the IBM's Quantum Computers. It can be used from building Quantum Algorithms to the Real World Applications.

Initially to learn Experimental Quantum Computing to perform the experiments people needs a Research Lab that works on quantum computing but now using qiskit and IBM's Quantum Computer through cloud we can perform all of the experiment using just our laptop and a stable internet connect.

How to program Quantum Computer using Qiskit ? after learning it. We can focused on the application areas like Quantum Chemistry : (1) To Calculate the bond lenght between two atom/molecules 
Quantum Algorithms : (1) Vazinrani Algorithm etc
Quantum Applications : (1) Quantum Games like QPong

### Installing Qiskit on our Computer and Start Writing Code in Qiskit and Accessing IBM's Quantum Computer from Cloud through API to our Developement Enviroment
