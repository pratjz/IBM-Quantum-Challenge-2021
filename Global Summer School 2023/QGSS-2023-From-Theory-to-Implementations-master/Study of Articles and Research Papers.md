Let's say an Indian student asked us how can we program a quantum computer like our classical computer to do day today tasks ? then lots of smaller questions arises from the statement like What we have to create ?, What is Quantum Program ? and What is Quatnum Computer ? etc types of question we needed to answer them.

The main focuse is hare is to make a better comparision between the classical computers and the future's quantum computers like how quantum computers functionality differs from the classical computer. What are the Principle that drives the quantum devices, is it same as of the classical devices ?

#### Information Representation in Classical Computer using bits vs Quantum Computer using qubits ?

Information's basic constructs : Numbers, Letters, Special-Symbols, Image, Signal, Text etc.



### Information Processing in Classical Computer using Classical Cicuits(Gates) vs Quantum Computer using Quantum Circuits(Gates) ?
